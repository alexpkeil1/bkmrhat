Description: Bayesian kernel machine regression (from the bkmr
    package) is a Bayesian semi-parametric generalized linear model
    approach under identity and probit links. There are a number of
    functions in this package that extend BKMR fits to allow
    multiple-chain inference and diagnostics, which leverage functions
    from the future, rstan and coda packages.
