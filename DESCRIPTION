Description: Bayesian kernel machine regression (from the 'bkmr'
    package) is a Bayesian semi-parametric generalized linear model
    approach under identity and probit links. There are a number of
    functions in this package that extend Bayesian kernel machine
    regression fits to allow multiple-chain inference and diagnostics,
    which leverage functions from the 'future', 'rstan', and 'coda'
    packages.  Reference: Bobb, J. F., Henn, B. C., Valeri, L., & Coull,
    B. A. (2018). Statistical software for analyzing the health effects of
    multiple concurrent exposures via Bayesian kernel machine regression.
